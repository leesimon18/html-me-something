					Hi! My Name is Moxie! I live with my two humans, Angelique and Simon. They've been my human mommy and daddy for about 3 and 1/2 years. To get to know me a bit better, I'll start from the very beginning. 
					</p>
			
					<p>
					My biological father was a Border Colie and my mother a Ausie Cattle Dog.
					</p>
				
					<p>
					My parents unfortunatly were both given up to th Jefferson County Humane Society, due to their humans unable to support them. Thankfully they were in the shelter together.

							Where I was born!
						</div>
					<p>
					I was born in the shelter on July 2nd, 2013 on the outskirts of Kansas City, which I still consider myself as contry folk. 
					I come from a litter of 7 and I was the second largest, following the coat-tails of my big brother Rocket.

					<p>
					My humans choose me just from pictures online. They didn't even second guess to decide on my other siblings. I guess it was love at first sight.

					I travled to my new home on Oct 12, 2013. There I would learn to potty outside, play ball, clean-up my toys, fly and catch my frisbee. Did I tell you how much I love flying through the air and catching my ball or frisbee. I also learned how to go through my food toys. And just between you and me... these food toys are way too easy. Now we're up to speed!

							This is but a very very small portion of toys I have since accumulated.
